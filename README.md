Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  DriverPass, the client wanted to have a web-based system thast would allow students to go in and take exams and train before the actual driving exam. this would include packages to choose from and also on the road training. 
What did you do particularly well?
  Working on understanding limitations, as well with my Diagrams. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  i would revise the project timeframes and deadlines. I liked this part, but I want to review as this could help me in my own job to implement goals, for projects I have. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  By understanding the needs from the customer and havin in person interviews, getting their feedbcack along the way as well. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I like to design Diagrams first( flowcharts), these would then be converted into Step by step process that allows me to see priorities and then assign deadlines and work from there.
